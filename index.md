### [recyclops](https://gitlab.com/spestushko/recyclops)
<img src="images/recyclops.png?raw=true"/>
Nowadays, there are many growing concerns of environmental pollution due to inadequate waste management systems.
Ineffective recycling causes air pollution due to harmful toxins released when incinerating plastic. 
Human and animal life is endangered by consistent release of non-degradable materials into rivers, ocean waters and landfills.
Last but not least, many factories are still employing human workers to sort tons of garbage on a daily basis. This approach is
harmful to workers and error prone.

My vision is to shift focus towards starting recycling process as soon as waste is thrown into the bin.

### [futureofcars](https://gitlab.com/futureofcars)
<img src="images/futureofcars.png?raw=true"/>
With RC car from Amazon, I put together a simple circuit on a breadboard to connect Raspberry Pi and carâ€™s DC motors. 
After that, I made the car to be drivable from a simple web client, with camera and ultrasonic sensor streaming data.
Next iteration for the project was to make the car drive itself. I wrote a lane detection algorithm, then put 
a Convolutional Neural Network in place that was learning from the camera feed.

At ETHWaterloo our team built a [project decentralizing online marketing](https://twitter.com/stephantual/status/919573072604270592?s=21).
Our vision was to build a decentralized digital marketing service to improve transparency and combat 
fraud among advertisers, publishers and everyday Internet users. In SmartAds, blockchain serves an an independent 
authority allowing for fair distribution of marketing royalties.
I carried out implementation of smart contracts powering system's backbone.

### [ReBook](https://github.com/NikitaKoren/ReBook)
<img src="images/rebook.png?raw=true"/>
Books in college can be pretty expensive. Buying used books from other students is great 
if you can find someone selling the book you are looking for. Scrolling a Facebook feed 
looking for your book is tedious. Posting a note on a physical bulletin board at school is outdated. 
We built a [service](https://rebookdev.herokuapp.com/) connecting book sellers with book buyers.
