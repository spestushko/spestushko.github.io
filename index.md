### Machine Learning

Have you ever wanted to build a robot? I have!
I ordered a RC car from Amazon, took it apart, put together a simple circuit with rPi and breadboard
to power DC motors, soldered it with those motors. Then I made the car to be drivable 
from a simple web client. The camera was later added streaming video feed from the car
to the web client(aka mission control). Then ultrasonic sensor had been added to the circuit 
streaming distance to the nearest obstacle in the way. 

And at that point I didn't feel like driving it anymore, I thought it should be driving itself!
Video streamed to the web client is analyzed by a lane detection algorithm, data is then 
saved into a dataset which is analyzed by a separate process and is picked up by a CNN for training. 

Lightning can drive itself! Barely, but...hey, it's still learning!

[player count ps4](https://gitlab.com/spestushko/player_count_ps4)
<img src="images/ps4_players.png?raw=true"/>
At some point I was torn between buying BO4 or not. I started Googling if I can check 
how popular the game is, maybe I can find a player count. That's when I first heard of a leak 
by some website that posted images of achievements received by players on PS4. Thousands on images
were leaked. Instead of going throudh each of them, I decided to OCR data and find stats for BO4.

- OpenCV

### Web development

[ReBook](https://github.com/NikitaKoren/ReBook)
<img src="images/rebook.png?raw=true"/>
Books in college can be pretty expensive. Buying used books from other students is great
if you can find someone selling the book you are looking for. Scrolling a facebook feed 
looking for your book is tedious. Posting a note on a physical bulletin board is outdated.
We built a service that allowed students to find the book they need and easily connect 
with people selling the books they need. 

Tech stack:
- Meteor
- MongoDb
- AWS
